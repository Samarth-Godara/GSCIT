# GSCIT (Genome Sequence Coverage Inspection Tool)

## The GSCIT software is designed to estimate the coverage depth and breadth and for quality-profiling of the sequenced reads quickly. 

### GSCIT is a platform-independent software implementing a novel Hash Table-based mapping algorithm in addition to various other prominent reads-profiling functionalities. The tool's coverage-indicating metrics provide novel insights regarding the input data with a user-friendly interface. In addition, the software does not need user-parameter tuning, as the artificial intelligence-based modules calculate multiple parameters on their own on run-time, which keeps the software from crashing while processing large genomes and limits the processing time. 

## Once clicked, the software may take 20-30 seconds to show up, depending upon the computerâ€™s configuration. 

### For each execution run, the software creates a new folder in the directory the software is running. The graphs, plots, and output logs are stored in the same folder.
